# **About this Project**

This system, built with Angular for the front-end and Spring Boot for the back-end, provides a seamless and efficient solution for managing a burger shop, 
from user authentication to dynamic menus, shopping carts, and a rewarding loyalty system. (coupons).

**PS:** This project is part of my personal portfolio, and I would greatly appreciate any constructive feedback you may have. 
Whether it's regarding the code structure, programming logic, best practices, or any other aspect that could help me grow as a developer. 
Your feedback will help me refine my skills and deliver increasingly robust and efficient work.
